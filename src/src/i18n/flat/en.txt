Normally you do not need to change it. Only required if you plan to use your own cloud.
Define how to concatenate Room and Function. E.g. with 'in': Light in living room.

Web instance, which will be shown for your connections from cloud.
You can define the languages to switch fast between US Alexa Skill and DE Alexa Skill.
If enabled, the settings will be stored only for this instance. So in the another instance the other names could be set.
For every command the text response will be generated. You can define here the Object ID , where this text must be written to. E.g. sayit.0.tts.text.
Workaround for missing connection to Alexa after the connection to cloud was lost. With this option you can restart adapter after each disconnection and it will work.
